UNI-verse Learning Management System
Aug 2023 - Dec 2023

Associated with MIT ADT University

Designed and developed UNI-verse, a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) using the Django web framework and PostgreSQL.
Significantly, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were employed to create an engaging and responsive user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.
The LMS caters to educational institutions, providing a robust platform for efficient course management, grade tracking, assessments,
and collaborative learning.

With a focus on building a performant and user-friendly system, I successfully implemented RESTful APIs using Django,
providing seamless communication and data interaction. PostgreSQL's advanced features were harnessed for efficient data management,
ensuring data integrity and optimal retrieval.
